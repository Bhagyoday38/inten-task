Step-by-Step Phishing Indicators Analysis
1. Sender Address Verification
Shown Sender: support@micr0soft-secure.com

Analysis: The domain is an apparent valid one but modified (micr0soft instead of microsoft). This is a fake/spoofed domain â€” a good phishing indicator.

2. Header Analysis
(Use a tool such as https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx or https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/)

Return Path: returnpath@phishingsite.ru

SPF/DKIM/DMARC Results: SPF fail, DKIM fail, DMARC not available

Analysis: Not authenticating correctly means that the message is coming from an untrusted location.

3. Suspicious Links or Attachments
Link Text: Update Your Account

Actual URL (on hover): http://security-check-authenticat1on.com/login

Attachment: SecurityUpdate.zip (holds Update.html)

Analysis: The link is to a non-related legitimate company domain. The attachment is a ZIP file, the most prevalent to conceal malicious content.

4. Language & Tone
Text Example:
"Immediate action required! Your account has been compromised. Failure to respond within 24 hours will result in suspension."

Analysis: Use of urgent/threatening language is a common phishing attack.

5. Spelling & Grammar
Text Example:
"We noticed unathorized logins to you're account from unknow devices."

Errors Identified: "unathorized," "you're" rather than "your," "unknow"

Analysis: Some grammatical and spelling mistakes, characteristic of phishing emails.

6. Incorrect URLs
Shown Link: www.paypal.com

Actual Link: http://paypal-secureverify.com

Analysis: Inconsistent hover links expose scam intentions.
